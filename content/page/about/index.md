I am Jose Torrado, a Software Developer with emphasis in Data Engineering based in the US. I have years of experience working with data at various scales and for a variety or purposes. My main area of expertise is Big Data processing - creating batch and streaming data pipelines. I do a good bit of Cloud Architecture design for my job, leveraging Google Cloud Platform (GCP) solutions mostly. 

I love studying and learning new things - pretty much anything. Lately I have been intereseted in the idea of being a [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath) - the concept really resonates with me so interesting to see there is a name for it! Especially taking hard concepts and making them simple enough for me to understand. I find that quite rewarding.

The picture, if you are curious, is an DALL-E generated render of my sweet dog Roco - although he looks a lot more thretening in there than he is.

Teaching is a great form of learning (see [Feyman Technique](https://medium.com/taking-note/learning-from-the-feynman-technique-5373014ad230)), so that is what I am hoping to achieve here. Share what I learn as I go, maybe it will be helpful for someone else!

Thanks for being here.
